# Summary

Thank you for reading this summary.

I'm Matt Wang, a native Chinese and a ESL learner, one who's gonna be a historian (which I'm not so sure if I want to).

Like most of you guys, I love programming. For love, I'm willing to exert myself.

Hum.. seems there will be a set of reading notes I'm gonna take.
